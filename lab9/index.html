		<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I fell behind on assignments and didn't get a partner so I did this lab by myself. It took me a while to display my JavaScript output as I had a couple of lines misspelled. It also took me a while to figure out how to get the css to work.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The output will display here: </p>

      <div id = "output" class = "changed">
        <script src = "js/lab.js"></script>
      </div>

      <div class = "linkbox">
          <a class="homelink" href="../index.html">&lt;&lt; Back home</a>
          <a class="sourcelink" href="js/lab.js" target="source">JavaScript Source &gt;&gt;</a>
      </div>
    </div>
