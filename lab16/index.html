	   <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>

		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>Experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>While doing this lab, I have no idea what's going on in the class so I'm not really sure how to complete it. The internet does most of the work for me. I haven't had the motivation to do anything due to life complications and I'm really struggling to recover.</p>
		<p>I had a really hard time trying to get the results to display, I keep getting an error.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
			<h4>Script Output</h4>
			<div id="output"></div>
