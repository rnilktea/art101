		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I had a lot of problems writing the JavaScript and getting it to work in general, but that was because when I tried to call the function, I had mispelled the function name. Instead of "sortUserName", I wrote, "sortUsername". </p>

		<h2>Results</h2>

			<div class = output>
				<h2>Script Output</h2>
				<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
			</div>
