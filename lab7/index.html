		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I had a lot of problems writing the JavaScript and getting it to work in general, but that was because when I tried to call the function, I had misspelled the function name. Instead of "sortUserName", I wrote, "sortUsername". </p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>When you open the webpage it will ask you for your name, and then the user types their name. After the user types their name and presses, "OK", this is the output: </p>
			<div class = output>
				<h2>Script Output</h2>
				<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
			</div>
