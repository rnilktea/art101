			<p>Hello, I'm Lokinah Khan, but I go by Loki. I'm an art major at UCSC in my last year. I mainly do prints, use watercolors, and digital art. I transferred to UCSC for the fall quarter in 2020, spent the next school year taking zoom classes, and now, I am finally on campus. Something interesting about me is that I have heterochromia, which means I have two different colored eyes. I have a brown eye and a greenish, hazel eye. I have two dogs and one cat, a shiba inu (the meme dog), a doberman, and a tabby cat. My favorite color is a dark, forest green.

	  	<p>Hi, I'm Vivian Zheng and I am a Computer Science Game Design major at UCSC for my third year. Recently I've been into the color yellow and my favorite sanrio character is Pompompurin. I'm into skateboarding, art, and reading different types of media. I've also raised a lot of different animals and right now have a hamster named Teacup. A fun fact about me is that I can wiggle my ears on their own. :)
