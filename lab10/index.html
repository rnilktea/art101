		<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JS events.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>This is the lab where I started to fall behind. After this point I don't really know what's going on and I know I didn't do this lab because I started struggling to understand the material. While doing this lab, I had a hard time getting the results to display.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>

			<div>
				<p>Input your name: </p>
				<input type = "text" id = "user-name">

				<button id = "my-button">submit</button>
