		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Our challenge was to code arrays and objects in JavaScript. The next steps were to understand the variables and understand how to acces the inner workings. Then, we had to understand their outputs towards the console.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not have any big problems with the code. The only issue was remembering the syntax of creating an object and understanding its references. Otherwise, the project was fairly easy.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here are the outputs of our work in this lab. It is a showing of the data within our arrays and objects in order to describe our modes of transportation.</p>
